Challenge-1 : Every Three Numbers
Letâ€™s start our challenging problems with a function that creates a list of numbers up to 100 in increments of 3 starting from a number that is passed to the function as an input parameter. Here is what we need to do:

1-Define the function to accept one parameter for our starting number
2-Calculate the numbers between the starting number and 100 while incrementing by 3
3-Store the numbers in a list
4-Return the list

    number_list = []
    if start > 100:
        return []
    else:
        for number in range(start, 101, 3):
            number_list.append(number)
        return number_list


print(every_three_nums(101))

"""
Code Challenge-2 : Remove Middle
Our next function will remove all elements from a list with an index within a certain range. The function will accept a list, a starting index, and an ending index. All elements with an index between the starting and ending index should be removed from the list. Here are the steps:

1-Define the function to accept three parameters: the list, the starting index, and the ending index
2-Get all elements before the starting index
3-Get all elements after the ending index
4-Combine the two partial lists into the result
5-Return the result

def remove_middle(lst, start, end):
    return lst[:start] + lst[end + 1:]


print(remove_middle([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42], 1, 3))


"""
Code Challenge-1 : More Frequent Item
Letâ€™s go back to our factory example. We have a conveyor belt of items where each item is represented by a different number. We want to know, out of two items, which one shows up more on our belt. To solve this, we can use a function with three parameters. One parameter for the list of items, another for the first item we are comparing, and another for the second item. Here are the steps:

1-Define the function to accept three parameters: the list, the first item, and the second item
2-Count the number of times item1 shows up in our list
3-Count the number of times item2 shows up in our list
4-If item1 shows up more, return item1. Otherwise, return item2

    num1 = lst.count(item1)
    num2 = lst.count(item2)
    if num1 > num2:
        return item1
    else:
        return item2


print(more_frequent_item([2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3], 2, 3))
