Challenge-3 : Always False
There are some situations that you normally want to avoid when programming using conditional statements. One example is a contradiction. This occurs when your condition will always be false no matter what value you pass into it. Let’s create an example of a function that contains a contradiction. It will contain a few steps:

1-Define the function to accept a single parameter called num
2-Use a combination of <, > and and to create a contradiction in an if statement.
3-If the condition is true, return True, otherwise return False. The trick here is that because we’ve written a contradiction, the condition should never be true, so we should expect to always return False.

def always_false(num):
    if num > 0 and num < 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False


# should print False
print(always_false(-1))
# should print False
print(always_false(1))
# should print False
