Magic 8-Ball
The Magic 8-Ball is a popular toy developed in the 1950s for fortune-telling or advice seeking.

Write a magic8.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.

Magic 8-Ball, should I do this project?

We’ll be using the following 9 possible answers for our Magic 8-Ball:

Yes - definitely.
It is decidedly so.
Without a doubt.
Reply hazy, try again.
Ask again later.
Better not tell you now.
My sources say no.
Outlook not so good.
Very doubtful.
The output of the program will have the following format:

[Name] asks: [Question]
Magic 8-Ball’s answer: [Answer]
For example:

Joe asks: Is this real life?
Magic 8-Ball's answer: Better not tell you now
Let’s get started!
